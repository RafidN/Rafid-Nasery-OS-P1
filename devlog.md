#### First Look at the Project

In all honesty I felt pretty confident about the project requirements and exactly what
I needed to do after the project discussion class, but have forgotten most of it. I know that 
I thought that the Logger and Encryption programs seemed trivial, and I will begin facing trouble 
when it comes to creating the Driver with all the Console ASCII UI, Java Processes, and input 
validation.

For now, I just wanted to get this project started so that I can visit this when I have more time
with the git repository and devlog already set up.
