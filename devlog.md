#### First Look at the Project

In all honesty I felt pretty confident about the project requirements and exactly what
I needed to do after the project discussion class, but have forgotten most of it. I know that 
I thought that the Logger and Encryption programs seemed trivial, and I will begin facing trouble 
when it comes to creating the Driver with all the Console ASCII UI, Java Processes, and input 
validation.

For now, I just wanted to get this project started so that I can visit this when I have more time
with the git repository and devlog already set up.

#### Read the Logger Requirements, Time to Implement

Looking at the logger file, it seems like a basic standalone program that takes a file as an input
argument for logs to be written to, and looks for "QUIT" to be called to quit logging. A lot of what 
is going on within the logger is just formatting the data to match what is on the slides.

#### This Session's Goals:

Complete the logger, test it, and maybe begin looking at the requirements for the encryption if
I have time.
